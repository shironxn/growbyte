# GROWBYTE [WIP]

An IoT-based smart plant monitoring and control system using ESP32. It features real-time data from multiple sensors and allows control of a water pump and light through a responsive web interface.

## Features

- Read temperature and humidity using DHT sensor
- Read soil condition using analog sensor
- Read DS18B20 soil temperature
- Control water pump and light using relays
- Pump turns on automatically when soil is too dry
- Built-in web dashboard (hosted on ESP32)

## Hardware Used

- ESP32 Dev Board
- DHT11 Sensor
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor (with 4.7kÎ© pull-up resistor)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 2-Channel Relay Module
- DC Water Pump 12v
- LED light or light module
- LCD I2C Module
- Jumper wires
